# Grocery Booking System

This project is a basic **Grocery Booking System** built with Spring Boot and PostgreSQL. The goal of the project is to allow users to manage grocery items and place orders with ease. It's containerized with Docker for simplified deployment and scalability.

## Features
- Add new grocery items (name, price, quantity).
- Create and view orders containing multiple items and quantities.
- PostgreSQL as the database to store all item and order-related information.
- Containerized using Docker, with a `docker-compose` setup for easy startup.

## How to Run
### Prerequisites
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** should be installed.
- Youâ€™ll need **Java 17** and **PostgreSQL** if you plan to run it locally without Docker.

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Pratik-kale/qp-assessment.git
   cd qp-assessment
